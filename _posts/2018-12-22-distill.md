title: "How many parameters are needed for 1-bit quantization?"
description: In this post, we statistically analyze the parameter expansion ratio required for the 1-bit quantization model to achieve 90% of the FP16 baseline performance. By comparing and reviewing the scaling factors of the sub 1-bit, 1-bit, and 1.58-bit models collected from various literatures, we present the optimal expansion ranges for each PTQ and QAT scheme. This provides specific guidelines for practical reference in the 1-bit quantization transition.

## Introduction

Since the introduction of the Transformer architecture, large language models have leveraged tens to hundreds of billions of parameters to achieve remarkable language generation capabilities. However, as the model grows in size, training the model requires excessive time, resources, and energy, making it challenging for real-world deployment and low-power edge utilization.
<div style="text-align: center;">

    alt="BitNet Architecture"
    style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; object-fit: contain;"
  />
</div>
<br>

To mitigate these challenges, 8-bit and 4-bit quantization techniques have been adopted to reduce memory usage with minimal performance loss compared to FP16, but when bit-width is reduced below 2 bits, both perplexity and zero-shot accuracy suffer drastic degradation <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13179" style="color:blue;">[1]</a>.  Extreme low bit quantization offers the potential to reduce Memory footprint and energy consumption  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11453" style="color:blue;">[2]</a>, but to offset the information loss from lower bit-widths, the model must be scaled up significantly. However, if the model size is unnecessarily increased, not only performance improvement becomes insignificant <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08361" style="color:blue;">[3]</a>, but additional computational resources and energy consumption increase and practical distribution becomes difficult. To that end, quantifying the minimum model size will be essential in terms of model distribution and operational cost-effectiveness. **So identifying the “optimal model size” that maintains FP16-level performance while still achieving efficient resource savings is essential.**

In particular, PTQ (Post-Training Quantization) and QAT (Quantization-Aware Training) require very different model scales, yet to date no study has quantitatively defined the optimal sizes for these two approaches. In this work, we conduct a thorough **survey of the leading 1-bit training methods** published since 2024 and **estimated the optimal model size for PTQ and QAT** by defining the scaling factor, providing concrete guidelines for balancing target performance and resource constraints when designing and deploying 1-bit LLMs.

## Exploring extreme low-bit quantization trends

### BitNet (2023) <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11453">[2]</a>
This was the first study to introduce QAT to a 1-bit LLM. In that paper, the authors proposed a scalable and stable 1-bit Transformer architecture and, in particular, introduced BitLinear, a 1-bit weight layer that can replace the standard fully connected layer.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img
    src="/assets/img/BitNet.png"
    alt="BitNet Architecture"
    style="max-width: 100%; height: 300px; object-fit: contain;"
  />
</div>
<br>
BitNet retains the familiar Transformer stacking of self-attention and feed-forward blocks, but replaces all weight matrix multiplications with BitLinear, which uses 1-bit weights. All other operations—including residual connections and LayerNorm—remain in 8-bit precision. This design choice is justified because (1) residual paths and LayerNorm incur only negligible compute and memory cost compared to the core Transformer operations, and (2) high-precision probabilities are required for accurate sampling.
<details markdown="1">
  <summary style="color: green;">View BitLinear's quantization & computational procedures</summary>

1. **Weight Binarization**  
   First, the weight $W$ is binarized to \(\{+1, -1\}\) via a sign function.  
   To zero-center the weights, subtract the mean $\alpha$, then use the scale factor  $\alpha$ to minimize the binarization error.  
   
   $$
   \alpha = \frac{1}{nm} \sum_{i,j} W_{ij},  
   \quad  
   \widetilde{W} = \operatorname{Sign}(W - \alpha),  
   \quad  
   \operatorname{Sign}(x) =  
   \begin{cases}  
     +1, & x > 0,\\  
     -1, & x \le 0.  
   \end{cases}  
   $$

2. **Activation AbsMax Quantization**  
   The activation  $x$ is quantized to $b$ bits.  
   
   $$
   \widetilde{x} = \mathrm{Quant}(x) 
     = \mathrm{Clip}\!\Bigl(x \times \tfrac{Q_b}{\gamma},\,-Q_b + \epsilon,\;Q_b - \epsilon\Bigr),  
   $$
   $$  
   \mathrm{Clip}(z,a,b) = \max\!\bigl(a,\min(b,z)\bigr),  
   $$
   $$  
   \gamma = \|x\|_\infty.
   $$

   Then, subtract the minimum $\eta$ = $\min_{i,j} x_{ij}$ from all values to shift into a fixed positive range, and apply the same quantization:

   $$
   \widetilde{x} = \mathrm{Quant}(x) 
     = \mathrm{Clip}\!\Bigl((x - \eta)\times \tfrac{Q_b}{\gamma},\,-Q_b+\epsilon,\;Q_b-\epsilon\Bigr),  
   \quad  
   \eta = \min_{i,j} x_{ij}.
   $$

3. **Matrix Multiplication**  
   Perform matrix multiplication using the binarized weight $\widetilde{W}$ and the quantized activation $\widetilde{x}$:

   $$
   y = \widetilde{W}\,\widetilde{x}.
   $$

4. **LayerNorm for Variance Preservation**  
   To ensure the output variance $\mathrm{Var}(y)\approx 1$, apply LayerNorm before activation quantization.  
   Using Sub-LayerNorm and the aforementioned quantization methods, the BitLinear layer is defined as:

   $$
   \begin{aligned}
     y &= \widetilde{W}\,\mathrm{Quant}\bigl(\mathrm{LN}(x)\bigr)\times \frac{\beta\,\gamma}{Q_b},\\
     \mathrm{LN}(x) &= \frac{x - \mathbb{E}[x]}{\sqrt{\mathrm{Var}(x) + \epsilon}},  
     \quad  
     \beta = \frac{1}{nm}\|W\|_{1}.
   \end{aligned}
   $$

### BitNet 1.58 (2024) <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17764">[4]</a>
Although it is based on the BitNet transformer architecture, we introduced a variant of 1-bit LLM with all individual parameters of **{-1, 0, 1}**. Despite its comparable performance to Full-Precision Transformer LLM, it dramatically reduced computation/memory cost. In-depth, a new scaling scheme was presented, and a computational Pradigm for new hardware for 1-bit LLM targets was presented.

<details markdown="1">
  <summary style="color: green;">Brief description of BitNet 1.58b and AbsMean quantization techniques</summary>

- All weight parameters are fixed to **\(\{-1, 0, +1\}\)**, preserving BitNet’s compression and compute advantages while  
  virtually eliminating standard matrix multiplications.

</div>
<br>

- Key benefits:  
  1. Dramatically reduced memory footprint.  
  2. Explicit feature filtering via zero-valued weights improves performance.  
  3. Perplexity and downstream task performance are on par with FP16.
<br>
 
 **AbsMean Quantization Function**

1. **Scaling**
   Scale the weight matrix  $W$ by its average absolute value $\gamma$.  
2. **Round & Clip**
   Round and clamp each element to the nearest value in \(\{-1, 0, +1\}\).  
   $$
   \widetilde{W} = \mathrm{RoundClip}\!\Bigl(\frac{W}{\gamma + \epsilon}, -1, +1\Bigr),  
   $$
   $$
   \mathrm{RoundClip}(x,a,b) = \max\bigl(a,\min(b,\mathrm{round}(x))\bigr),  
   $$
   $$
   \gamma = \frac{1}{nm}\sum_{i,j} |W_{ij}|.
   $$

### Sub 1-bit Quantization, STBLLM (2024) <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01803">[5]</a>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img
    src="/assets/img/stbllm_1.png"

</div>
<br>

STBLLM (Structured Binary LLM) is a new compression framework that structurally binarizes large language models (LLMs) beyond conventional 1-bit precision. While LLMs offer state-of-the-art performance, their high memory and compute demands limit deployment on resource-constrained environments. STBLLM observes that sparsifying a portion of binary weights in 1-bit LLMs does **not significantly degrade performance**, suggesting room for more aggressive compression.

<details markdown="1">
  <summary style="color: green;">Summary of STBLLM Four Key Techniques</summary>

**1. Structured Sparsity with N:M Pattern**

- STBLLM employs N:M structured pruning to encode \(N\) non-zero weights in every \(M\)-slot group, enabling **extremely high compression**.
<br>
- This pattern is also hardware-friendly and supports **accelerated inference**.

**2. Standardized Importance (SI) Metric**

- To overcome the instability of Hessian-based importance scores, STBLLM proposes a lightweight importance metric that considers both weight magnitude and input feature norm.
<br>
- Importance formula:  
  $$
  S_{i,j} = \sigma\bigl(\mu(|W_{i,j}|)\bigr) \cdot \left\| X_{:,j} \right\|_2
  $$
  - $\mu$: Mean of absolute weights  
  - $\sigma$: Normalization function  
  - $X$: Input feature matrix

**3. Layer-wise Adaptive Binarization**

- Each layer’s relative importance $\alpha_i$ is computed and used to apply  **aggressive compression for less critical layers**, and **preserve more precision in key layers**.
<br>
- Formula:  
  $$
  \alpha_i = \frac{\omega_i}{\omega_{\text{total}}}
  $$
  - $\omega_i$ = $\|W_i\|_2$: L2 norm of layer \(i\)  
  - $\omega_{\text{total}}$: Sum of norms across all layers

**4. Non-salient Aware Quantization**

- Weights are divided into three zones based on their importance: **sparse**, **intermediate**, and **dense**.
<br>
- Different binarization strategies are applied to each zone to reduce total bit usage while maintaining task-level performance.

## Methodology for Finding the Scaling Factor & Results

### Scaling Factor
The model size required to perform more than 90% of the FP16 baseline zero-shot accuracy is expressed as a scaling factor.

$$
Scaling\ Factor = \frac{Model\ size\ for\ Low\ bit\ training\ method}{Model\ size\ for\ FP16\ baseline}
$$
<br>
**Example**: 1-bit quantization model requires 1.8× the size of the original model to perform 90% → Scaling Factor = 1.8


### Results
Based on our survey of references <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17764" style="color:blue;">[4]</a>–<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11295" style="color:blue;">[8]</a>, we extracted the scaling factor required to approach FP16 performance. For PTQ and QAT, the scaling factors according to the bit format are shown in the table below. When the model size tested in the reference was less than 90% of the performance of the zero-shot accuracy, it was marked as <span style="color: red;">Inconclusive (Red).</span>

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img
    src="/assets/img/Scaling_Factor.png"
    alt="PTQ vs QAT Table"
    style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; object-fit: contain;"
  />
</div>
<br>

- Since the PT-BitNet paper itself has no direct comparison results with the FP16 baseline, we compared it against the Full-Precision baseline performance presented in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01803" style="color:blue;">[5]</a>.

- BitNet_v2 series took and used the values compared to the FP16 baseline provided by the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17764" style="color:blue;">[4]</a> as it was.

In the table, the light green area is a common benchmark evaluated in both PTQ and QAT, limited to W1.58A8 format. Through the following graph, it is possible to determine which method of PTQ and QAT may more efficiently minimize the parameter expansion through fair conditions (same bit width, same format).

</div>
<br>

### Summary of key results
- **Sub 1-bit training**
<br>The Sub 1-bit method fell short of the baseline on almost all benchmarks.(especially A4)

- **1-bit training**
<br>Lowering the weight to 1 bit in the QAT scheme did not achieve a reference point on most benchmarks, even if the activation bit was high.

- **1.58-bit training**
<br>The PTQ method requires a model size that is two to five times higher than the QAT.

In the case of the PTQ method, it can be seen that the reference point is below the reference point in most benchmarks. It is believed that QAT requires a smaller model than PTQ because PTQ only quantizes the already learned model as it is, while QAT reflects the quantization process during learning to help parameters correct the 'quantization error' when learning. In other words, the efficiency of PTQ drops sharply when the bit-width is extended low<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11295" style="color:blue;">[8]</a>, suggesting the insight that QAT is essential for extreme low bit training.


## Contribution & Conclusion

In this blog post, we conducted a comprehensive review of major 1-bit and sub 1-bit quantization studies published since 2023. We found that PTQ approaches typically require model sizes than QAT methods. In addition, we suggest the possibility that quantizing the weight to less than 1.58 bits in the QAT scheme can dramatically increase the model size. In this study, **we quantitatively analyzed how much model parameters should be expanded for 1-bit quantization**. This provides practical guidelines on how much model size should be increased when converting individual neural networks to 1-bit.


## Limitation
Since it has set a subjective standard of 90%, it may lack persuasive power in objective terms.
